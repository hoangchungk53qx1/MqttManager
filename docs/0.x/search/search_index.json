It has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT). MQTT reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.</p>"},{"location":"#docs","title":"Docs","text":""},{"location":"#0x-release-docs-httpshoangchungk53qx1githubiomqtt-managerdocs0x","title":"0.x release docs: https://hoangchungk53qx1.github.io/mqtt-manager/docs/0.x","text":""},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"MQTT 3.1 :heavy_check_mark: Automatic Reconnect :heavy_check_mark: MQTT 3.1.1 :heavy_check_mark: Offline Buffering :heavy_check_mark: LWT :heavy_check_mark: WebSocket Support :heavy_check_mark: SSL / TLS :heavy_check_mark: Standard TCP Support :heavy_check_mark: Message Persistence :heavy_check_mark:"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<pre><code>MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 hoangchungk53qx1\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
